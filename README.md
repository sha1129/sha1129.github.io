Hi, my name S(h)(a)(q) H.oq, and I am a recent graduate of a BCom in Business Systems Analysis. I am proud to have received Magna Cum Laude Honours for my hard work and dedication to my studies. I also developed a passion for solving problems and understanding their underlying reasons. 

My short-term goal will be to pursue a Master's degree further to develop my skills and knowledge in the Business Analytics field. In the long term, I plan to use my skills and expertise to impact society positively.

Outside of work, I enjoy keeping up with current technologies and staying active. I love reading, cooking, and working out in my free time. These activities help keep my mind and body sharp and allow me to bring my best self to every challenge.
