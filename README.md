<h1>About me</h1>

Hi, my name is S(h)(a)(q) H.oq, and I hold a Bachelor of Commerce degree specializing in Information Technology. I graduated with Magna Cum Laude Honours and was named to the Dean’s List for academic excellence. Throughout my studies and professional experience, I developed a strong interest in building practical data solutions and improving processes through automation and reporting.

In my recent roles, I’ve designed end-to-end dashboards, written advanced SQL queries, and built reporting workflows using tools like Power BI, Power Automate, and Python. I enjoy translating business needs into clear, actionable insights and working closely with cross-functional teams to deliver value through data. I’ve also participated in industry competitions, such as the Power BI DataViz World Championships, where I applied advanced reporting techniques to real-world challenges.

Outside of work, I’m always looking for ways to grow — whether it’s reading, staying active, or exploring new tools and technologies. I believe in continuous improvement, and I bring that mindset to every project I take on.
